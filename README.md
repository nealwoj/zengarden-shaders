# Zen Garden
Includes a paper lantern and light shaft shader made in Unreal Engine. These shaders were used in a Zen Garden demo as a final project on my portfolio. Note: Shaders mildly out of date since I did more work in the Zen Garden team repository.
This was an assignment for a graphics class at Champlain College.
